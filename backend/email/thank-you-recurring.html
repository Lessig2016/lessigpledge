The power of this campaign is based on people like you in our national network, who connect all the important issues to the fundamental issue of inequality and then take action to fix it.  Using the power of the internet, let's see if we can build a campaign to win the White House and then create the most lasting political change in our lifetime.
</p>
<p>
Thank you again for your support, for doing everything you can to spread the word about our campaign, and for making equal citizens the first issue in the 2016 Presidential campaign.
</p>
<p>
Sincerely,
</p>
<p>

P.S.: Our goal is to raise a million dollars every month in order to run a competitive campaign in the Presidential Primary. Now, I'm not trying to raise money from a bunch of really rich people at fancy fundraisers, so I need you to do what you can monthly to help make this campaign possible. If you <a href="https://lessig2016.us/donate">make your contribution monthly</a>, we'll also send you fewer fundraising emails. Thanks!
