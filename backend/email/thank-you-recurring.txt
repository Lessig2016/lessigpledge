Dear {name},

Thank you for your donation to my campaign for president. None of this would be possible without your support.

This is just the beginning. With your help, we will reach voters across the country who care about citizen equality. The 2016 presidential election will become a referendum â€” and a mandate for real reform.

We appreciate your generous contribution. This is a people-powered campaign, so please be sure to tell your friends and family members about what is at stake and how they can get involved.

With gratitude,
--Lessig
