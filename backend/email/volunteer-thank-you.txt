Hello {name};

Thank you for signing up to volunteer at www.LessigforPresident.com.  Your support is what makes it possible for us to take on politics as usual with this groundbreaking campaign to change the debate in 2016 and restore citizens equality.

Because this is a kickstarter-like campaign, we will only launch the campaign if we meet the goal, which is $1,000,000 by Labor Day, Sep 7th, 2015.  So please click on the link below to contribute whatever you can to reaching this first critical goal:

The power of this campaign is based on people like you in our national network, who connect all the important issues to the fundamental issue of inequality and then take action to fix it.  Using the power of the internet, let's see if we can kickstart a campaign to win the White House and then create the most lasting political change in our lifetime.

Thank you again for your support, for doing everything you can to spread the word about our campaign, and for making equal citizens the first issue in the 2016 Presidential campaign.

Sincerely,

Larry Lessig

PS.  I'm not trying to raise money from a bunch of really rich people at fancy fundraisers, so I need you to do what you can to help make this campaign possible.  Click here to make a contribution now.  Thanks!
