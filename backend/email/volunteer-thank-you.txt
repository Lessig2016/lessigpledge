The power of this campaign is based on people like you in our national network, who connect all the important issues to the fundamental issue of inequality and then take action to fix it.  Using the power of the internet, let's see if we can kickstart a campaign to win the White House and then create the most lasting political change in our lifetime.

Thank you again for your support, for doing everything you can to spread the word about our campaign, and for making equal citizens the first issue in the 2016 Presidential campaign.

Sincerely,

Larry Lessig

P.S.: I'm not trying to raise money from a bunch of really rich people at fancy fundraisers, so I need you to do what you can to help make this campaign possible. Please make a contribution now: http://lessig2016.us/donate. Thanks!
