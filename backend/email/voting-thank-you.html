The power of this campaign is based on people like you in our national network, who connect all the important issues to the 
fundamental issue of inequality and then take action to fix it. Using the power of the internet, let's build a campaign to win the White House and then create the most lasting political change in our lifetime.
</p>

<p>
Thank you again for your support, for doing everything you can to spread the word about our campaign, and for making fixing our democracy the first 
issue in the 2016 Presidential campaign.
</p>

<p>
Sincerely,
</p>

<p>
Larry Lessig
